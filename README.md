"# sound-sleuth"

Notes for now:
Main Screen has login and instructions
instructions links to instructions.html in views which must be completed (@vikas)
login links to spotify auth which redirects to localhost:8888/callback which redirects either to index.html or play.html


Play allows you to search for an artist displaying its picture, then choose to play which redirects to game.html
game.html is not started but has javascript linked to gamelogic.js (@justin)

gamelogic.js has code for retrieving all the songs. These must be converted into some quiz format. (@justin)

Possible bugs: same songs included multiple times
